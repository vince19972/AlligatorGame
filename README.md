This project is part of midterm project of the class [MobileLab](https://github.com/mobilelabclass) at ITP, NYU. The goal of this assignment is to build an app based on iOS [MultipeerConnectivity Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity). We decided to build an [alligator dentist game](https://www.target.com/p/crocodile-dentist-game/-/A-47015254?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Toys%2BShopping&adgroup=SC_Toys&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9073489&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1248099&ds_rl=1246978&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsZ3kBRCnARIsAIuAV_Rdg922X3VDg5cLfkG2uazpmaAQuluWyWkL52WnuN1hIxIR5YhHvYkaAtHBEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), which was an extension of the assignment work [Dreamy Sun built](https://www.chenyusun.com/mobile-lab-one-button) in second week of the class.
